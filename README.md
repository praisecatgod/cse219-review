## CSE 219 Spring 2014 Midterm Review Session ##

I primarily intended this document to serve as a nice way to access my lecture notes in case all hell breaks loose again when attempting to hook up my laptop to the projector. But hey, some of you kids might like an extra copy.

Added are some bonus goodies that might help you with the next homework assignment. [And even beyond that!](https://github.com/yvds/ramble-on "steal my code and I will hunt you down when you sleep and place very awake and playful cats in your room")
